A Game made in Unreal Engine 5.1.1 for the course "Game Mechanics" at Stockholm University. 

Title: Fleshcape

Description: Imagine a dark souls-like game where consuming flesh is what keeps you going, and where infecting yourself with parasites might not be such a bad idea when you're up against crazed scientists -- who would like nothing more than to turn you into a mindless drone. That’s what Fleshscape is all about -- using all means necessary to make it out alive. But, will you still be you?
